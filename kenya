This guide provides comprehensive security recommendations for human rights defenders (HRDs) operating in Kenya. The guide is designed to help HRDs navigate Kenya‚Äôs legal, social, and digital landscape safely, especially when engaging in dissent, protests, and advocacy work.

1. SOCIAL MEDIA GUIDANCE FOR DISSENT

üìú Familiarize Yourself with Local Laws:

	‚Ä¢	Understand specific laws in Kenya that can be used against human rights defenders, especially regarding online speech and protests.
