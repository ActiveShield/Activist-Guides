## Introduction

Human rights defenders and activists face significant risks in their work. This repository provides essential operational security guides to help protect individuals engaged in activism and dissent. The guides cover topics such as social media use, physical security during protests, digital security, and legal advice during arrests or questioning.

## Guides by Country

### USA


The current turbulence in the US threatens to reinvigorate smoldering domestic divides in the lead-up to the elections. A contentious campaign period may lead to intimidation and violence at polling places, as well as renewed mobilization by opportunistic far-right groups around claims of voter fraud, anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, and access to abortion.

### Mexico

Mexico ranks among the world’s most extreme conflicts in the ACLED Conflict Index, a position it is unlikely to cede, as the flow of people and drugs to the United States — two key drivers of conflict between criminal groups — are at all-time highs, while the 2024 general elections are likely to kindle political violence.

### Palestine

Violence is expected to continue across the Palestinian territories, including after the current high-intensity fighting in Gaza ends. Tensions in the West Bank, already alarmingly high before 7 October, have escalated even further in recent months, as clashes between Palestinian armed groups and the IDF have intensified and settlers have ramped up violence.


### Yemen

The domestic situation in Yemen remains tense despite the recent announcement of an imminent roadmap under UN auspices. A regional escalation in the Red Sea could nevertheless derail ongoing peace efforts and lead to a resurgence of the conflict. This intricate situation results in domestic, regional, and international actors finding themselves in diverse predicaments.

### Sudan

Emboldened by its successes in Khartoum and Darfur, and the lack of diplomatic efforts to achieve a complete ceasefire, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) is moving southward and eastward to force the Sudanese army (SAF) into submission.


### Myanmar

Despite multiple setbacks, fighting between the Myanmar military and resistance forces is likely to continue in 2024. The NUG’s strategy of “all roads lead to Nay Pyi Taw” has led the military to take action to further fortify the capital, increasingly under threat of infiltration from the resistance forces.

### Kenya

Political tensions in Kenya remain high as the government faces increased pressure from opposition forces. Corruption scandals, electoral disputes, and rising costs of living have triggered mass protests, leading to confrontations between security forces and civilians. Human rights defenders are at risk of harassment, particularly when advocating for electoral reforms or investigating state corruption.

### Sudan

Sudan continues to grapple with civil conflict as the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) vie for control of key regions. The humanitarian crisis worsens, with widespread displacement and violence. Human rights defenders and journalists face heightened risks, particularly those documenting war crimes and advocating for ceasefire efforts.

### Egypt

Egypt’s human rights situation remains critical, with increased repression of dissent and crackdowns on civil society. Under the guise of anti-terrorism laws, activists, journalists, and HRDs are frequently arrested. The Egyptian government uses extensive surveillance and censorship, making digital security a top concern for HRDs in the country.

### Iraq

Despite reduced levels of open conflict, Iraq remains unstable due to sectarian tensions, economic woes, and political fragmentation. Human rights defenders face threats from both government forces and non-state actors when advocating for minority rights, governmental transparency, or protesting poor public services.

### Myanmar

Ongoing violence between the Myanmar military and resistance forces continues to ravage the country. Human rights defenders, particularly those supporting ethnic minority groups and the democratic movement, are under constant threat of arrest, surveillance, and violence as the military junta intensifies its efforts to suppress dissent.

### Lebanon

Lebanon remains in a state of socio-political and economic collapse. With growing discontent over political corruption and economic mismanagement, protests continue, often met with violent crackdowns. Human rights defenders face risks from both state and non-state actors, especially when investigating corruption or advocating for reform.

### Jordan

Jordan’s political landscape remains relatively stable compared to its neighbors, but economic challenges and political discontent simmer under the surface. HRDs advocating for economic reforms, workers’ rights, and press freedom often face harassment, legal threats, and restrictions on peaceful assembly.

### Pakistan

Political instability in Pakistan has deepened, with clashes between political factions and increased violence targeting minority groups. Human rights defenders working on issues like blasphemy laws, women’s rights, and freedom of speech often face significant threats, including legal harassment, imprisonment, or extrajudicial violence.

### India

India continues to witness rising tensions due to the government’s hardline stance on dissent and nationalism. Human rights defenders, particularly those working on issues like religious freedom, caste discrimination, and free speech, are at risk of legal harassment, digital surveillance, and physical attacks by both state and non-state actors.

### Canada

While Canada is known for its respect for civil liberties, Indigenous rights defenders continue to face significant challenges, including state surveillance and criminalization of protests. Environmental activists and those advocating for Indigenous sovereignty face intimidation, especially when challenging resource extraction projects.

### Congo (DRC)

The Democratic Republic of Congo remains fraught with conflict as various armed groups vie for control of mineral-rich regions. HRDs documenting human rights abuses, sexual violence, or illegal mining practices face severe threats from both government forces and militias. Insecurity and impunity make activism particularly dangerous.
