## Introduction

Human rights defenders and activists face significant risks in their work. This repository provides essential operational security guides to help protect individuals engaged in activism and dissent. The guides cover topics such as social media use, physical security during protests, digital security, and legal advice during arrests or questioning.

## Guides by Country

### USA


The current turbulence in the US threatens to reinvigorate smoldering domestic divides in the lead-up to the elections. A contentious campaign period may lead to intimidation and violence at polling places, as well as renewed mobilization by opportunistic far-right groups around claims of voter fraud, anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, and access to abortion.

### Mexico

Mexico ranks among the world’s most extreme conflicts in the ACLED Conflict Index, a position it is unlikely to cede, as the flow of people and drugs to the United States — two key drivers of conflict between criminal groups — are at all-time highs, while the 2024 general elections are likely to kindle political violence.

### Palestine

Violence is expected to continue across the Palestinian territories, including after the current high-intensity fighting in Gaza ends. Tensions in the West Bank, already alarmingly high before 7 October, have escalated even further in recent months, as clashes between Palestinian armed groups and the IDF have intensified and settlers have ramped up violence.


### Yemen

The domestic situation in Yemen remains tense despite the recent announcement of an imminent roadmap under UN auspices. A regional escalation in the Red Sea could nevertheless derail ongoing peace efforts and lead to a resurgence of the conflict. This intricate situation results in domestic, regional, and international actors finding themselves in diverse predicaments.

### Sudan

Emboldened by its successes in Khartoum and Darfur, and the lack of diplomatic efforts to achieve a complete ceasefire, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) is moving southward and eastward to force the Sudanese army (SAF) into submission.


### Myanmar

Despite multiple setbacks, fighting between the Myanmar military and resistance forces is likely to continue in 2024. The NUG’s strategy of “all roads lead to Nay Pyi Taw” has led the military to take action to further fortify the capital, increasingly under threat of infiltration from the resistance forces.
