Operational Security Guide for Human Rights Defenders in France

This guide provides practical recommendations for human rights defenders (HRDs) operating in France to enhance their physical, digital, and legal security when engaging in dissent, protests, and advocacy work. Though France upholds many civil liberties, certain actions or situations may put HRDs at risk. This guide offers strategies to navigate these risks safely.

1. SOCIAL MEDIA GUIDANCE FOR DISSENT

üìú Familiarize Yourself with Local Laws:

	‚Ä¢	Understand French laws that can be used against HRDs, especially related to online speech, assembly, and activism.

	‚Ä¢	Public Order Laws: Familiarize yourself with the French regulations on protests and public gatherings, as well as how speech deemed to disrupt public order may be prosecuted.

üìù Write and Share Responsibly:

	‚Ä¢	Write Responsibly (if using a real account):
	‚Ä¢	Frame statements carefully, focusing on questions and critiques that promote debate rather than direct accusations.
	‚Ä¢	Example: Instead of stating, ‚ÄúThe government is violating human rights,‚Äù say, ‚ÄúWhat safeguards are in place to ensure human rights are respected?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Share Responsibly (if using a real account):
	‚Ä¢	Verify all content before sharing. Be mindful that sharing false or incendiary content can have legal repercussions.
	‚Ä¢	Even private messages can be subjected to scrutiny if flagged, so apply caution.

üö´ What to Avoid Writing or Sharing:

	‚Ä¢	Avoid direct incitement to violence or civil disobedience, which can lead to legal consequences.
	‚Ä¢	Refrain from publishing or sharing defamatory statements about public figures or institutions.
	‚Ä¢	Avoid posting content that can easily be traced back to your identity, especially if it could expose you to legal or social risks.

üîí Separate Personal from Political:

üë• Safety in Numbers:

Photos and Browsers:

	‚Ä¢	Avoid unencrypted messaging apps such as SMS or Facebook Messenger for sensitive communication.
