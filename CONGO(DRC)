Operational Security Guide for Human Rights Defenders in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)

This guide aims to equip human rights defenders (HRDs) in the DRC with security recommendations to protect themselves physically, digitally, and legally while engaging in activism, dissent, and advocacy work.

1. SOCIAL MEDIA GUIDANCE FOR DISSENT

üìú Familiarize Yourself with Local Laws:

	‚Ä¢	Understand specific laws in the DRC that may be used against human rights defenders, particularly online speech and organizing.
	‚Ä¢	Cybercrime Law: Know the laws that govern the internet and online content, including the criminalization of misinformation and defamation.
	‚Ä¢	Defamation Laws: Be aware of what constitutes defamation in the DRC and the penalties associated with it.
	‚Ä¢	Public Order Law: Familiarize yourself with legal guidelines for public gatherings and how speech and posts that incite disorder may be prosecuted.

üìù Write and Share Responsibly:

	‚Ä¢	Write Responsibly (if using a real account):
	‚Ä¢	Use careful language to avoid direct accusations. Frame your posts as questions or appeals for clarification instead of accusations.
	‚Ä¢	Example: Instead of saying, ‚ÄúThe government mismanages resources,‚Äù ask, ‚ÄúWhat measures are in place to ensure proper resource management?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Share Responsibly (if using a real account):
	‚Ä¢	Verify the accuracy of any content you share, and make sure it aligns with safe communication practices.
	‚Ä¢	Remember that private messages can be monitored just as public posts can.

üö´ What to Avoid Writing or Sharing:

	‚Ä¢	Avoid posting explicit calls for protests or civil disobedience that could be interpreted as incitement.
	‚Ä¢	Refrain from direct criticism of government institutions or politically sensitive issues, particularly those involving the military or foreign interests.
	‚Ä¢	Do not post content that can be traced back to your personal identity if it could put you at risk.

üîí Separate Personal from Political:

	‚Ä¢	Create anonymous accounts for any sensitive posts.
	‚Ä¢	Use different email addresses and virtual phone numbers.
	‚Ä¢	Utilize VPN services to mask your IP address and protect your identity online.

2. PHYSICAL SECURITY DURING PROTESTS

üó∫Ô∏è Risk Assessment and Planning:

	‚Ä¢	Establish communication with trusted contacts and set meeting points in case of separation.
	‚Ä¢	Prepare contingency plans for arrest, police violence, or unexpected escalations.

üöî Avoiding Security Forces:

	‚Ä¢	Do not film or take photos of security forces, as this could lead to retaliation.

	‚Ä¢	Use scarves or bandanas for additional anonymity and protection from tear gas.

üë• Safety in Numbers:

	‚Ä¢	Attend protests with a group of trusted individuals, and make sure someone outside the group knows where you are and your expected return time.

üìû Emergency Preparedness:

	‚Ä¢	Memorize key emergency contact numbers or keep them written down.
	‚Ä¢	Inform trusted individuals of your protest plans and expected timelines.

‚è±Ô∏è Time Management:

	‚Ä¢	Disable biometric security (e.g., fingerprint or face recognition) and use strong passcodes.

Photos and Browsers:

	‚Ä¢	Use apps like Tella for encrypted and secure media recording.

Secure Communication:

	‚Ä¢	Use Signal for secure messaging, enabling disappearing messages.
	‚Ä¢	Avoid using unencrypted messaging apps like Facebook Messenger or regular SMS for sensitive conversations.

Backup and Device Security:

	‚Ä¢	Regularly back up sensitive data to offline, secure storage.
	‚Ä¢	Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your accounts for an extra layer of security.

VPN and IP Protection:
